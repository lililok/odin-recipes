    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings.
        These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings.
        They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist.</p>
